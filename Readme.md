==================================

This is a simple app that is meant to synchronize photos from flickr to facebook.

This is a work in progress
-----------

It will require you to authenticate with your facebook user name and password to start
Then you will enter in your flickr username.

All the photos you want transferred must be made public.  This is just temporary until I can get to 
proper flickr authentication.
