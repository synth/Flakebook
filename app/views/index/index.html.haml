        First, currently I'm only supporting importing images from Flickr that are marked as public.  At some point I'll work in authorization, so stay tuned

        Don't worry you'll have another screen to confirm things and select additional options
      %li
        Also, this will check if an album with the same name exists, and if it does it will drop photos into that album
